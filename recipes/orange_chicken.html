                <li>Low sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>Chopped green onions</li>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prior to cooking this recipe cook 2 cups of uncooked rice following directions on the package. Let rice cook and put in a container in the refrigerator.</li>
                <li>Cut one pound of chicken into small cubes and season with some salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
                <li>In a large container combine flour, cornstarch, 1 tsp each of salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and chili powder.</li>
                <li>Toss chicken around in the flour and cornstarch mixture. Shake off excess and set aside on a plate.</li>
                <li>In a skillet over medium high heat add 2 tbsp of oil and 2 tbsp of butter. Once butter has melted add the chicken to the skillet.</li>
                <li>Cook chicken on both sides until chicken is cooked through and golden brown. Once fully cooked remove the chicken from the pan.</li>
                <li>Add 4 slices of bacon that have been chopped into small pieces to the hot skillet. Stir bacon around in the pan until cooked.</li>
                <li>Add cooked rice and frozen mixed vegetables to the skillet. Add more oil to the rice as needed. I usually add 2-3 more tablespoons.</li>
                <li>Stir well. Season with some salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Add soy sauce. I like to start with 2 tbsp of low sodium soy sauce. (You can also add in some fish sauce here, but I typically don't have it on hand.)</li>
                <li>Create a well in the middle of the rice and add 4 whisked eggs. Stir eggs around until cooked and mix the eggs with the rice mixture.</li>
                <li>Stir well and if needed spread the rice mixture between two large skillets if you really want the crispy texture of “fried rice”. If you have a large wok that would be ideal.</li>
                <li>Keep cooking and stirring rice until it’s cooked to your liking. Taste and season with more salt, pepper, garlic powder, or soy sauce if needed.</li>
                <li>Toss the chicken in Orange sauce and pour the chicken over the top of the fried rice.</li>
                <li>Add chopped green onions and serve!</li>
